So everybody can check it out

Hi! So this isn't well organized

./Code contains 2 things:
  1. The source coordinates for the original logo circles. These coordinates were extracted from the .sketch file
  2. Some javascript code that converts the source coordinates to Processing code
  
./iota_animation:
  Is a Processing https://processing.org/ project that animates the circles from one position to the next.
  
There are 2 psd files with the forward and backward render

There is a Sketch file that has the vector logo
